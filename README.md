# dictBot
discord bot for resolving acronyms and defining search terms. 
##### *Type: Discord-Bot*

### Description:
>Search acronym meanings and search definitions of words/terms/etc within discord chat. This application used www.acronymfinder.com and www.wikipedia.org respectively.
>
### Notes:
>Quite reliable and decent speed. Uses the python Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape the relevant data from the site corospnding to the search.  
>
>This is not meant to be downloaded form git as an application in whole, but rather to make the source code public. Token not included. To run this bot as your own, you will need to create a Discord bot linked to your account at `https://discord.com/developers/applications` to recieve a valid login token. That token will need to be saved inside a `.env` file as `TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN` within the same directory as the source files..
>
>*NEVER SHARE YOUR LOGIN TOKENS WITH ANYONE!*
>
>I may start running these bots on a dedicated instance and make them available to invite to your server in the near future. Stay tuned for future implementations.
